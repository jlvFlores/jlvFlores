### About *Moi*
Our tale begins at the end of a century, with a boy born in Mexico, but raised in the U.S., who is now living back in Mexico *(I know it's confusing, but trust me it's part of the character development)*. *"Ahem"* Anyway, he attended the Technological University of a state that doesn't exist to most, named [Tlaxcala](https://www.google.com/search?q=Did+you+mean%3F+non+existent&rlz=1C1ONGR_esMX1018MX1019&sxsrf=AJOqlzVUfog5PbN2myqnD4XVW0-0EMu5_A%3A1677537342766&ei=PjD9Y9KvLoCNur8P_Iub2A4&ved=0ahUKEwjSxqbL4bb9AhWAhu4BHfzFBusQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=Did+you+mean%3F+non+existent&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIECCMQJzoECCEQFToGCAAQCBAeOgUIABCiBDoKCAAQ8QQQHhCiBEoECEEYAFDzEFjtvgNgm9gDaAFwAXgAgAHSAogB1gmSAQcyLjYuMC4xmAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp). While studying there, he embraced the spider's art of web development 🕸, and... *and... I don't know, story telling is definitely not my strong suit. I'll tell you what is my strong suit,* 💥 **web development**. 🤯 <br> <br>

I've worked with JavaScript for over **2 years** now and Ruby for about **half a year**, and you best believe I'm still learning new things every day. 
Also, there are a couple of little secrets I've hidden over this .md file, see if you can find them all. <br> <br>
**Hint:** *Some are actually hidden in the file's code.*
